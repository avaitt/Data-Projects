# Data Projects
This is a place to share my personal projects and data explorations using Python.

### Image Classification with Garden Perennials

In this notebook I explored some machine learning techniques used in image classification - namely the torch ML library. In doing so I buillt a deep learning model to classify new images of garden perennials and the top 5 "classes" (i.e. flower species') that a new image would likely fall under.

### Anomaly Detection using Log Files
