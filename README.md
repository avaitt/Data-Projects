# Summer 2019 Data Analysis Project

This is a project completed during my 3 months as an intern at LPL Financial. I used TensorFlow and Keras in order to perform analysis on 80 Kilobytes worth of data logs consisting of user timestamps. These users were individuals who used the company portal to perform actions such as performing transactions, communicating with advisors, and handling fees.

I used Python in order to search for anomailes across the 3000 timestamps collected. Using python libraries I mapped out data over 3 months and used linear regression in order to find anomalous timestamps based on surrounding datapoints.
